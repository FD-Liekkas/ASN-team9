# travel-app-api
API written in Flask for our travel application

## How to run
- For the sake of simplicity, I have push the data.db to our github, so you guys don't need to set up SQL.
- Install `pip`, `python` and `virtualenv`.
- Move to the folder `cd travel-app-api`
- Create virtual environment `virtualenv venv`
- Activate the virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the app: `python app.py`

The app should run on port 5000
